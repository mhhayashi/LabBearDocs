# LabBearDocs

LabBear is a software solution for controlling laboratory devices remotely. It is in development and not available to the public.

LabBear targets a specific workflow that is used by physicists:
1. Hardware devices (such as a laser) connected to a laboratory PC
2. Drivers for the hardware written in Python
3. Python scripts to run experiments using the drivers
4. A desire to run these scripts from another PC in the lab (or via VPN), with minimal changes
