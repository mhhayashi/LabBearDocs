## No Added Security

LabBear does NOT provide any security. It assumes that the laboratory network is secure. A properly configured router / firewall will block all connections from unauthorized devices. Ensure that only authorized devices are on the network. 

## No Added Safety

LabBear does NOT prevent you from destroying hardware devices. It is the responsibility of the driver to prevent misuse. However, even the strictest restrictions may not be able to prevent purposeful destruction of hardware devices.
