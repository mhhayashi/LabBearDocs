LabBear does NOT provide any security. It assumes that the laboratory network is secure. A properly configured router / firewall will block all connections from unauthorized devices. Ensure that only authorized devices are on the network. 

LabBear does NOT prevent you from destroying hardware devices. It is the responsibility of the driver to prevent misuse. However, even the strictest restrictions on a Python driver will not prevent purposeful destruction of hardware devices.
